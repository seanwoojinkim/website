I'm <span class="p-name">Sean Woojin Kim</span> (seanwooj), a designer and coder in Brooklyn. 

I run [Wooj](https://wooj.design), a lighting company I started in 2021. We design and 3D-print lamps from recycled plastic in Brooklyn. 45 printers, made-to-order production, all in-house. :)

<span class="p-note">These days, I'm trying to do more work on interactive systems: generative art, tools and visualizations that track heart rate and brainwaves, and little experiments on how people connect through technology.</span>

Right now I'm working on a small installation that visualizes when people's physiology syncs up in real time using heart rate monitoring and consumer EEG.

## Practice

I work on physical products, creative coding, and experiential art. I'm interested in objects and interfaces that create space for contemplation and connection.

Focus areas: generative systems, biometric sensing, product design, interactive installations, real-time rendering, hardware prototyping.

## Approach

I'm interested in working on every part of a project, even if I don't know how to do it yet.
