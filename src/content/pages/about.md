I'm <span class="p-name">Sean Woojin Kim</span> (seanwooj), a designer and coder in Brooklyn. 

I run [Wooj](https://wooj.design), a lighting company I started in 2021. We design and 3D-print lamps from recycled plastic in Brooklyn. 45 printers, made-to-order production, all in-house. :)

<span class="p-note">I've been having a lot of fun working on interactive projects: tools and visualizations, playing around with consumer eeg and heart rate monitors. I'm working through a project that tries to help people synchronize their biometrics. We'll see!</span>

Right now I'm working on a small installation that visualizes when people's physiology syncs up in real time using heart rate monitoring and consumer EEG.

## Practice

I work on physical products, creative coding, and experiential art. I'm interested in objects and interfaces that create space for contemplation and connection.

## Approach

I'm interested in working on every part of a project, even if I don't know how to do it yet.
