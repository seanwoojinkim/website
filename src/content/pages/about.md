I'm Sean Kim, a designer and coder in Brooklyn. 

I run [Wooj](https://wooj.design), a lighting company I started in 2021. We design and 3D-print cordless lamps from recycled plastic in Brooklyn. 45 printers, made-to-order production, all in-house. :)

These days, I'm trying to do more work on interactive systems—generative art, biometric installations, experimental interfaces—that explore how people connect.

Right now I'm working on biometric installations that visualize when people's physiology syncs up in real time using heart rate monitoring and consumer EEG.

## Practice

I work across physical products, computational systems, and experiential art. I'm interested in objects and interfaces that create space for contemplation and connection.

Focus areas: generative systems, biometric sensing, product design, interactive installations, real-time rendering, hardware prototyping.

## Approach

I'm interested in working on every part of a project, even if I don't know how to do it yet.
